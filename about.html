			<h2>What is SB19?</h2>
				<p>SB19 is a five-member boy group under 1Z Entertainment. The group debuted on October 26, 2018 
					with their first debut digital single, "Tilaluha". Their name stands for 'Sound Break 19'.</p>
					
				<p>“SB” in SB19 came from the initials of ShowBT because the group is the first Pinoy idol group 
					in their company, while “19” is derived from the Philippines’ (+63) and South Korea’s (+82) 
					country codes. When each number sums up (6+3+8+2), they get 19. This signifies the collaboration 
					between South Korea and Philippines. </p>
					
				<p>SB19 eventually came up with a new meaning which is "Sound Break" because the main goal of the 
							group is to break into the music scene with their "New" and "Fresh" sound</p>
